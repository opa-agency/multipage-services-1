In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. Protocol offers two ways to authenticate your API requests: Basic authentication and OAuth2 with a token — OAuth2 is the recommended way.</p><h2>Basic authentication</h2><p>With basic authentication, you use your username and password to authenticate your HTTP requests. Unless you have a very good reason, you probably shouldn't use basic auth. Here's how to authenticate using cURL:</p><div class="bg-zinc-900 dark:bg-zinc-950 rounded-lg p-4 my-6 overflow-x-auto"><pre class="text-zinc-200 m-0"><code>curl https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -u username:password</code></pre></div><div class="not-prose bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 border border-red-200 dark:border-red-900/50 rounded-lg p-4 my-6"><p class="font-semibold text-red-900 dark:text-red-200 m-0">⚠ Please don't commit your Protocol password to GitHub!</p></div><h2>OAuth2 with bearer token</h2><p>The recommended way to authenticate with the Protocol API is by using OAuth2. When establishing a connection using OAuth2, you will need your access token — you will find it in the Protocol dashboard under API settings. Here's how to add the token to the request header using cURL:</p><div class="bg-zinc-900 dark:bg-zinc-950 rounded-lg p-4 my-6 overflow-x-auto"><pre class="text-zinc-200 m-0"><code>curl https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"</code></pre></div><div class="not-prose bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 border border-yellow-200 dark:border-yellow-900/50 rounded-lg p-4 my-6"><p class="font-semibold text-yellow-900 dark:text-yellow-200 m-0">🔒 Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.</p></div><h2>Using an SDK</h2><p>If you use one of our official SDKs, you won't have to worry about any of the above — fetch your access token from the Protocol dashboard under API settings, and the client library will take care of the rest. All the client libraries use OAuth2 behind the scenes.</p></div></template>

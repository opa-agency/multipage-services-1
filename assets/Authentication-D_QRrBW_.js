In this guide, we&#39;ll look at how authentication works. Protocol offers two ways to authenticate your API requests: Basic authentication and OAuth2 with a token — OAuth2 is the recommended way.</p><h2>Basic authentication</h2><p>With basic authentication, you use your username and password to authenticate your HTTP requests. Unless you have a very good reason, you probably shouldn&#39;t use basic auth. Here&#39;s how to authenticate using cURL:</p><div class="bg-zinc-900 dark:bg-zinc-950 rounded-lg p-4 my-6 overflow-x-auto"><pre class="text-zinc-200 m-0"><code>curl https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \\

When establishing a connection using OAuth2, you will need your access token — you will find it in the Protocol dashboard under API settings. Here&#39;s how to add the token to the request header using cURL:</p><div class="bg-zinc-900 dark:bg-zinc-950 rounded-lg p-4 my-6 overflow-x-auto"><pre class="text-zinc-200 m-0"><code>curl https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \\

All the client libraries use OAuth2 behind the scenes.</p>`,12)])])}const u=o(a,[["render",i]]);export{u as default};
